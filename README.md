# Node.js-Express.js-MongoDB Project

This REST API was created to use to support a ecommerce store project that I developed in my course.

The quickest way to get start with Node.Js & Express, just clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/catfreitas/database_ecom.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start Express.js app at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ npm start
```
